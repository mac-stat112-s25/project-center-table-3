    "text": "This article, from SkillPath, lists and describes what they define as eight “simple characteristics of a great team.” These characteristics can be largely generalized as balancing and appreciating the individuality of the team, while also encouraging community building and interdependence. Specifically, they emphasize individual achievement and skill sets, recognizing how those apply to the team, and taking the opportunity to develop those skills and incorporate them in a team setting. The article also says that an effective team needs to build an environment of trust, respect, and communication, where team members can be open with and rely on one another, coordinating as a team to make decisions, rather than unilaterally. The key to an effective team, then, is respect – both for the community and for the individuals within the community.",

We will be breaking down the results by state, reviewing various variables that may have attributed to Sheinbaum Pardo’s overwhelming victory. We chose this topic because we wanted to learn more details about the recent Mexican federal elections, which were significant for the political trajectory of Mexico, and likely by extension the United States, but were not widely discussed in the media at the time.\n\n\nImplementation and reponsibility plan",
